This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.


## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```


## Local Development

Clone this repository and start the local dev server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This command will launch a local development server and open the site in your browser. Changes are hot-reloaded automatically.

### Start docs in German

To launch the documentation in German, run:

```bash
pnpm run start --locale de
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Switching languages via the language switcher is currently not supported.


## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content in the `build` folder. You can serve it using any static file hosting service.


## Deployment

### Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true pnpm deploy

### Without SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> pnpm deploy

If you're using GitHub Pages, this will push the production build to the `gh-pages` branch.


## Screenshot Guidelines

| Component        | Width  |
|:----------------|:------:|
| Full screen      | 1920px |
| Menu             | 400px  |
| Pop-up / Modal   | 500px  |

> Highlight key elements in the screenshot with red borders or boxes if needed.

### Example

To include a screenshot in your documentation, use the following format:

```jsx
<img src={require("./../../img/PATH/EXAMPLE.png").default} alt="EXAMPLE" width="1920" />
```

- Use `require(...)` for image paths so they are bundled correctly by Docusaurus
- Always include a meaningful `alt` text to improve accessibility and SEO


## Markdown Guidelines

To maintain a consistent structure across all docs, follow these formatting conventions:

### Frontmatter Example

All `.md` files must begin with a valid frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
id: getting-started
title: Getting Started
sidebar_position: 1
description: A quick intro to OpenCloud
---
```

- `id` must be unique and match the filename (without `.md`)
- `sidebar_position` defines the ordering in the sidebar
- `description` is required to ensure consistent SEO metadata and link previews. Always include a meaningful and concise description.

### Heading Hierarchy

Use the correct heading levels:

```markdown
# Page Title

## Section Heading

### Subsection Heading

#### Optional Sub-subsection
```

> Do not skip heading levels (e.g., don‚Äôt go from `##` directly to `####`).


### Info Blocks

Use Docusaurus-style info blocks to highlight important content:

```markdown
:::tip
Helpful tip content goes here.
:::

:::info
General information goes here.
:::

:::warning
Warnings go here.
:::

:::danger
Critical notices go here.
:::
```

### Lists and Steps

Use regular markdown for ordered lists. Do **not** nest deeply.

```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

## Format Before Pushing

Before committing changes, ensure proper formatting using:

```bash
pnpm format:write
pnpm lint:md:fix
```

These commands will:

- Format all project files
- Lint and auto-fix markdown formatting
- Ensure consistent style across documentation

Thanks for helping us keep the docs clean, professional, and easy to read!
