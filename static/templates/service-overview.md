The {props.service_name} service is part of the OpenCloud backend architecture and is compiled inside the opencloud single binary.

The environment variables `OC_RUN_SERVICES`, `OC_EXCLUDE_RUN_SERVICES` and `OC_ADD_RUN_SERVICES` can be used to control which services are started when the OpenCloud server is launched. This services machine name is <code>{props.service_machine_name}</code>. See the [Configuration System](../../configuration/config-system) documentation for more details on configuring services.
