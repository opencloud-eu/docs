- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

#### Docs Style

 - ### Tone & Approach

    - Clear and Concise: Instructions are direct and to the point, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
    - User-Friendly: Uses simple language suitable for all experience levels.
    - Step-by-Step Guidance: Instructions are structured in a logical sequence to ensure ease of following.
    - Encouraging & Reassuring: Positive reinforcement (e.g., "Done!" or "Now moved!") helps confirm successful actions.

- ### Formatting & Structure

    - Headings & Subheadings: Use clear and well-structured section titles (e.g., 'How to create files and folders').
    - Bullet Points: Used to break down steps for better readability.
    - Bold Highlights: Important actions (e.g., “Click on ‘Create’”) are bolded for emphasis.
    - Images & Visual Aids: Screenshots are included to visually reinforce each step.
    - Whitespace & Line Breaks: Use generous spacing to improve readability and avoid clutter.

- ### Visual & Interactive Elements

    - Icons & Buttons: Highlight UI elements such as the “+ New” button and the three-dot menu.
    - Action-Oriented Phrasing: Use verbs like 'Click,' 'Select,' 'Enter,' and 'Confirm' to encourage user interaction.
    - Code-Like Formatting: Uses inline code or UI-style highlights for menu options.
    - Screenshots should highlight important aspects, and you may use red frames to emphasize specific buttons or areas.
    - Defined sizes for screenshots:

        | content           | size          |
        |:-                 | :-:           |
        |complete screen    | width="1920"  |
        |menu               | width="400"   |
        |pop up             | width="500"   |
