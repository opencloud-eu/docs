#### Docs Style

 - ### Tone & Approach

    - Clear and Concise: Instructions are direct and to the point, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
    - User-Friendly: Uses simple language suitable for all experience levels.
    - Step-by-Step Guidance: Instructions are structured in a logical sequence to ensure ease of following.
    - Encouraging & Reassuring: Positive reinforcement (e.g., "Done!" or "Now moved!") helps confirm successful actions.

- ### Formatting & Structure

    - Headings & Subheadings: Well-organized with clear section titles (e.g., “How to create files and folders”).
    - Bullet Points: Used to break down steps for better readability.
    - Bold Highlights: Important actions (e.g., “Click on ‘Create’”) are bolded for emphasis.
    - Images & Visual Aids: Screenshots are included to visually reinforce each step.
    - Whitespace & Line Breaks: Generous use of spacing to avoid clutter and improve readability.

- ### Visual & Interactive Elements

    - Icons & Buttons: Emphasizes UI elements like the “+ New” button and three-dot menu.
    - Action-Oriented Phrasing: Uses verbs like "Click," "Select," "Enter," and "Confirm" to promote interaction.
    - Code-Like Formatting: Uses inline code or UI-style highlights for menu options.
    - Screenshot should show the important aspects and you can put red frames around the specific buttons or areas.
    - Defined size for screenshots:

        | content               | size          |
