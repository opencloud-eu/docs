# Why you should use Spaces – and now they differ from classic sharing

## The problem with classic sharing

### Let’s take a simple example

- Alan creates a folder called "Project" and shares it with several Persons
  <img src={require("./img/why-spaces/spaghetti.png").default} alt="Member menu" width="500"/>
- Later, Alan leaves the organization
- As Alan's account is deleted, some shared folder disappears
- User loses access to some folders and their content

  <img src={require("./img/why-spaces/alan-left.png").default} alt="Member menu" width="500"/>

### This scenario highlights several risks

- Potential data loss when the original owner leaves
- Project data counts toward personal quotas, which is not ideal for teamwork
- Administrative overhead when ownership needs to be transferred
- Spaghetti sharing chaos – users get lost in their "Shared with me" or "Shared with others" sections

## The Benefits of Using Spaces

Spaces are designed to overcome these limitations and provide a more stable, team-friendly solution

- Organization-owned: Spaces belong to the organization, not individuals.
- Collaborative management: Multiple users can manage a Space together.
- Dedicated quota: Each Space has its own storage limit, separate from personal quotas.

:::note
Spaces make collaboration simpler, safer, and more scalable — especially in professional environments.
