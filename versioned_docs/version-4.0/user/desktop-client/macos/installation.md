# Installation on macOS (.pkg file)

The OpenCloud Desktop Client is provided as a signed `.pkg` installer for macOS.  
This installation method integrates cleanly into the system and follows the standard macOS installation process.

## Download the Installer

Download the latest or preferred `.pkg` file from the official release page:

- [OpenCloud Desktop Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/desktop/releases)

Save the file to your Downloads folder.

## Run the Installer

1. Double-click the downloaded `.pkg` file.
2. The macOS installer will open automatically.
3. Follow the on-screen steps to complete the installation.

The installer places OpenCloud Desktop in the system’s Applications directory.

## Launch the Application

After installation, you can start OpenCloud Desktop from:

- the Applications folder
- Launchpad
- or by using Spotlight (press `Cmd + Space` and search for “OpenCloud Desktop”)

## First Start

On first launch, the client will guide you through:

- signing in with your OpenCloud account
- selecting sync settings
- configuring basic preferences

The application is now ready to use on macOS.

## Uninstallation

To remove the OpenCloud Desktop Client from your system:

1. Open the Applications folder.
2. Locate OpenCloud Desktop.app.
3. Drag the application to the Trash or right-click and select Move to Trash.
4. Empty the Trash to complete the removal.

Optional configuration files may remain in the user directory:

- `~/Library/Application Support/OpenCloud/`
- `~/Library/Preferences/eu.opencloud.desktop.plist`
- `~/Library/Logs/OpenCloud/`

These files can be deleted manually if a full cleanup is desired.
