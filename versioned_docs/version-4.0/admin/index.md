# Welcome to OpenCloud Admin Docs

Welcome to OpenCloud, your self-hosted file sharing platform: Secure, simple and reliable. This documentation helps you to get started, configure, and maintain OpenCloud.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -L https://opencloud.eu/install | /bin/bash
```

## What’s Inside?

- Getting Started – Set up and deploy OpenCloud
- Configuration – Customize and integrate with existing systems and storage
- Maintenance – Learn how to update, backup and migrate

## Documentation Versions

Our documentation is versioned to ensure you always find the right information for your software version.

- Rolling Version: Reflects the current development state. Changes are continuously added, but the documentation may be incomplete, as new features might not yet be documented. Ideal if you are using a pre-release or development build.
- Stable Release Versions: Documentation for officially released versions — frozen, reviewed, and unchanged since publication.

You can switch between the Rolling version and specific Release versions using the version menu in the top right corner.
