# External Sharing (public links)

Public links - external sharing of files and folders in OpenCloud
With public links, you can share files and/or folders across organizations. Here are the steps to create a public link:
Steps to create a public link:
Open sharing options:
Click on the “three-dot menu” next to the file or folder name you want to share.
Select Share:
Select “Share” from the drop-down menu.
Open sidebar window:
A sidebar window will open on the right side of the screen.
Add public link:
Scroll down in the sidebar window and click on “Add link”.
Set options for the public link:
A pop-up window will open where you can configure the following options:
Options in the pop-up window:
Rights for the link:
Select the desired access rights for the recipients:
“Can view": The link recipient can view and download the file, but cannot edit or upload files.
“Can edit": The link recipient can view, download, edit and delete the file, as well as upload files to the folder.
“File Drop (secret)": The link recipient can only upload files, but cannot view or edit the content.
Set password for the link:
Activate the password by entering it in the input field under “Password”.
The password requirements appear below the input field.
There are three icons:
One icon displays the password unencrypted to verify your entry.
Another symbol copies the password to the clipboard.
The last icon generates a random password automatically.
Set expiration date for the link:
Enter a date under “Expiry date” to set a time limit for the link. Once the date has expired, the link is no longer accessible.
Create link:
Once all options have been set, click on “Copy link” to generate the public link.
The link is now created and can be shared with the recipients.
With these steps you can share files and folders securely and individually with external users!
