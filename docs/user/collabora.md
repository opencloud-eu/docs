Collabora Online allows you to edit documents (text, spreadsheets, presentations) directly in your browser without any additional software.  
The integration with OpenCloud provides seamless access to your files and enables real-time collaboration.

## Features in OpenCloud

### Open files directly from the cloud

All documents stored in OpenCloud can be opened directly in Collabora.

### Collaborative editing

Multiple users can work on the same document simultaneously, with real-time synchronization of changes.

### Insert images from OpenClou

You can insert images stored in OpenCloud directly into your documents.

### Saving and versioning

Changes are saved automatically, and all versions are retained within OpenCloud.

### Supported formats

Collabora Online supports common office formats such as `.odt`, `.docx`, `.ods`, `.xlsx`, `.odp`, and more.

## Notes

- Performance depends on your internet connection and the size of the document.
