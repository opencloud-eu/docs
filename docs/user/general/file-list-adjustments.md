# Files-List customizations in OpenCloud

Clicking on the settings icon on the right side of the user interface takes you to the options for customizing the view. Here you can customize the display.

<img src={require("./img/files-list-adjustment/settings-icon.png").default} alt="Settings icon" width="400"/>

## Available options

1 **Display hidden files**  
- Activate or deactivate the display of hidden files.  
- Hidden files are often system or configuration files.

2 **Display file extensions**  
- Specify whether the file extensions (e.g. `.docx`, `.jpg`) should be displayed after the file names. This makes it easier to identify file types.

3 **Files per page**  
- Specify how many files should be displayed per page in a folder.  
- Useful for navigating in folders with many files.

4 **Tile size**  
- Customize the size of the icons and buttons:  
    - **Small tiles** for a more compact view.  
    - **Large tiles** for a clearer view.
