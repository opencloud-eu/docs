# Upload Files in iOS

With the OpenCloud iOS App, you can easily upload files and make them available for offline use.

## Open the Desired Folder

Navigate to the folder where you want to upload a file.

## The "+" Icon

Tap the “+” icon in the top right corner

<img src={require("../img/files-and-folders/upoload-make-available-offline/upload-plus-button.png").default} alt="Plus Button" height="400"/>

## Upload options

From the menu, you can choose an Upload option:

- "Upload file" – upload a file from your device's Files app
- "Upload from your photo library" – upload an existing photo or video from your media library

  <img src={require("../img/files-and-folders/upoload-make-available-offline/upload-options.png").default} alt="Upload Options" height="400"/>

## Confirm the Selection

Choose the file or media you want to upload. The upload will start automatically.

## Make Files Available Offline

You can also make files available offline so they are accessible without an internet connection.

- Tap the three dots (⋯) next to the file

  <img src={require("../img/files-and-folders/upoload-make-available-offline/three-dots.png").default} alt="Make available offline" height="400"/>

- Select “Make available offline”

  <img src={require("../img/files-and-folders/upoload-make-available-offline/make-available-offline.png").default} alt="Make available offline" height="400"/>
  The file will be downloaded and stored locally on your device.

- Offline files are marked with a cloud icon with a checkmark.

  <img src={require("../img/files-and-folders/upoload-make-available-offline/marked-offline.png").default} alt="Make available offline" height="400"/>

## Remove Offline Availability

To free up space:

- Tap the three dots (⋯) again on an offline file
- Select “Remove offline access”

These features ensure you’re always prepared — even when you’re offline!
