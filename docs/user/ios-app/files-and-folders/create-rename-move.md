# Create - Rename - Move


## You can easily create new text, table and presentation files in the OpenCloud iOS App. You can also rename files and folders or move them to another location.



### How to create files and folders
- Click on the **“+”** button at the top of the bar.

<img src={require("../img/files-and-folders/create-rename-move/create-new.png").default} alt="create new" height="400"/>


- In the menu, select either **“Folder”** or the desired **"file type"** that you want to create.


- Enter a **name** for the file or folder in the window that appears.


- Click on **“Create”**.


**Done!** The file or folder is created. If it is a file, it is automatically opened in edit mode.



### To rename files or folders
- Open the **context menu** by either: 
    - **right-clicking** on the file or folder,
    - or clicking on the **three dots** on the right in the corresponding line.


- Select the **“Rename”** option.


- Enter the **new name** for the file or folder in the window that appears.
Confirm by clicking on **“Rename”**.



**Done!** - the new name is applied!



### How to move files or folders
- Make a selection: 
    - Select the file(s) or folder(s) you want to move.


- Open the context menu:
    - **Right-click** on the file or folder,
    - or click on the **three dots** in the corresponding line.


- Select the **“Cut”** option from the menu.

(Alternatively, you can use the **“Cut”** function in the **action bar** at the top).


- Select destination:
    - Navigate to the folder or location where the file or folder should be moved to.
    - Click on **“Paste here”** in the **action bar**.




The file or folder is **now moved** to the new location and **no longer exists** in the original location.
