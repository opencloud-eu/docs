### 📑 Scan Document

Use your iOS device to scan paper documents:

1. Select **"Scan document"**

You can then:

- Crop or rotate the scan
- Switch color modes (color, grayscale, black & white)
- Choose a file format (PDF, JPEG, PNG)
- Save as a single-page or multi-page file

The scanned document will be saved in your OpenCloud account.

### To rename files or folders
- Open the **context menu** by either: 
    - **right-clicking** on the file or folder,
    - or clicking on the **three dots** on the right in the corresponding line.


- Select the **“Rename”** option.


- Enter the **new name** for the file or folder in the window that appears.
Confirm by clicking on **“Rename”**.



**Done!** - the new name is applied!



### How to move files or folders
- Make a selection: 
    - Select the file(s) or folder(s) you want to move.


- Open the context menu:
    - **Right-click** on the file or folder,
    - or click on the **three dots** in the corresponding line.


- Select the **“Cut”** option from the menu.

(Alternatively, you can use the **“Cut”** function in the **action bar** at the top).


- Select destination:
    - Navigate to the folder or location where the file or folder should be moved to.
    - Click on **“Paste here”** in the **action bar**.




The file or folder is **now moved** to the new location and **no longer exists** in the original location.
