 This is how you can add a new member to your Space:

#### Add a member:

1. **Open Space:**  
   Go to your Space and open the member menu.

    <img src={require("./img/add-user/member-menu.png").default} alt="Member menu" width="1920"/>    

2. **Search for a member:**  
   In the member menu, you can search for the user from your organization that you want to add.

    <img src={require("./img/add-user/search-user.png").default} alt="search user" width="400"/>       

3. **Assign rights:**  
   Select the desired rights for the member, e.g. whether the person may only read or also edit.

   <img src={require("./img/add-user/choose-rights.png").default} alt="Choose rights" width="400"/>    

4. **Add:**  
   Click on “Add” to invite the member to the Space.

   <img src={require("./img/add-user/member-added.png").default} alt="Member added" width="400"/> 

### Important notes:

- The added member has immediate access to the Space.
- **Attention:** Every user with the “can manage” right has the authorization to deactivate and delete the Space.
- A deleted Space **cannot be restored**, so be careful who you grant these rights to.

This gives you the ability to add members to your Space and set the permissions accordingly!

5. **Change rights:** 

   YTo change the rights of a member, open the member menu, click on the corresponding user and select the desired new rights.

   <img src={require("./img/add-user/change-rights.png").default} alt="Change rights" width="400"/> 

6. **Remove members:** 

   Open the member menu, click on the three-dot menu next to the member you want to remove and select “Remove member”.

   <img src={require("./img/add-user/remove-user.png").default} alt="Remove user" width="400"/>

   The removed member immediately loses access to the space.
